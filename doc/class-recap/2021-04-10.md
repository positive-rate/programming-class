# Class 4

## Lost Lastpass master passwords

It is very important that you never lose your Lastpass master password. In a next class we will set up recovery codes, so you can recover your password if you lose it. Without those, you can never get back into your account. This account is very secure like that, because it contains all your passwords. So it is very sensitive and you have to be very careful!

## Getting started with Notion

We learned how to create pages in Notion, for taking notes. We learned that you can put a page inside another page.

Don't use the mouse when using Notion, do everything with the keyboard! You want to make a page? Type `/page` and hit Enter. Want to make a checklist? Type `/check` or `/todo` or anything else that makes sense, use the arrow keys to get to the item you want, and hit Enter.

Make lists by starting a line with `-` and hitting Spacebar.

Write code inside your text by putting a `` ` `` in front and behind the code, like this: `if a < 5`.

Write code with color highlighting for a specific language, such as Python, in a big block, by typing `` ``` ``:

```python
if a < 5:
    print ("Four or less a!")
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

We learned some new keyboard shortcuts this week. They should be in your Notion notes! I will share a full list in a later summary.

## The `while` loop

Today we learned about one kind of loop: the `while` loop. Last class, we wrote the same code six times. This time we learned that that is not necessary. You can just write it once, inside a loop!

This is how a very simple `while` loop works:

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
```

First we make a variable called `i`. You can call this anything you want of course. I chose `i` for `index`. We set `i` to `0`.

Then the `while` loop starts. The first thing it does, is check `i < 5`: is `i` smaller than `5`? Well, `i` is `0`, so yes. Because it is true, we enter the loop. Now the next two lines which are indented will run.

The first line just prints `i`, and the second one makes `i` to be `i + 1`, or: it adds one to `i`. Then we are at the end of the loop. When you get to the end of a loop, you go back to the beginning! Back to the `while` line.

So `while` checks again if `i < 5`. `i` is now `1`, which is still less than `5`, so we enter the loop again. Print again, and increase `i` by one again. And go back to the start of the loop again. And again, and again.

Finally, `i` will be `5`. We still go back to `while` to check `i < 5`. But this time, it is false (not true). When the check is false, we exit the loop and skip the code inside the loop.

The output of this program is:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

We put a lot more code into the loop inside our program. We even put `if` statements inside the loop. This is possible: you can put anything you want inside a loop! Here is the code we ended up with:

```python
lives = 5
while lives > 0:
  answer = int(input())
  lives = lives - 1

  if answer == secret:    
    print("너는 죽지 않았어. 그러나 곧 죽겠지")
    exit()

  if answer > secret:
    print("수가 너무 커") 
  else:
    print("수가 너무 작아")

print("너는 살았어 ㅊㅋ")
```

The last line is not inside the loop! Why? Because it does not have the same indentation (the same amount of spaces in front) as the other lines inside the loop.

In this code we don't count up, but count down. We start with five lives, and subtract one life each time the loop runs: each iteration of the loop.
